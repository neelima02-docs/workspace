Building EC2 with Terraforms

What is Terraform? Terraform is a powerful Infrastructure as Code (IaC) software tool offered by HashiCorp. It facilitates provisioning and managing your infrastructure on-prem and in the cloud. It can be easily extended with the help of its plugin-based architecture.

What is Terraform Used For? Terraform can be connected with different infrastructure hosts and achieve complex management scenarios and compliance across multiple clouds. Its configuration can be easily packaged, shared, and reused in the form of Terraform modules.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Traditionally, the process of preparing a Windows or Linux server for your lab or data center consisted of several steps involving mouse clicks, running scripts, and manually configuring different aspects such as storage and networking. Doing this at scale for hundreds or thousands of servers becomes increasingly complex and error-prone.

IaC makes this process much easier by allowing you to define and provision your infrastructure with the help of a declarative language. With this approach, you can gain consistency, repeatability, and enhanced reliability.

In addition to day one infrastructure setup, this approach also helps with the management of any changes that happen to your infrastructure along the way, commonly referred to as drift management. (If youâ€™re interested in how to manage Terraform workflows at scale, see: How to Manage Terraform at Scale)

Other IaC tools include Cloud Formation Templates (CFT) for AWS, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates for Microsoft Azure, and Deployment Manager for Google Cloud.

How Does Terraform Work? Terraform Workflow A typical Terraform workflow will consist of the following steps:

Step 1. Write Declare your infrastructure resources as code in Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL).

Step 2. Review the Plan Terraform will display a plan to add or remove resources based on the comparison of your declared infrastructure and the current state of any existing resources.

Step 3. Apply init Prepare your working directory for other commands validate Check whether the configuration is valid plan Show changes required by the current configuration apply Create or update infrastructure Destory Destroy previously-created infrastructure
